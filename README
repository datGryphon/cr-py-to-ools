# Crypto Tools and Examples in Python
### Caleb Wastler
## Program 1

Demonstrates the attack on AES-CBC which allows an adversary to 
decrypt the message by querying a black-box padding oracle.

## Program 2

Demonstrates how to generate primes and test their primality 
with the Miller-Rabin test as well as how to use the primes
for RSA trapdoor encryption. Thirdly, the program shows how
to use a basic merkle tree implementation to verify the 
integrity of a filesystem. 

## Program 3

Program 3 shows how to use the RSA trapdoor function for 
signatures and how to solve the proof of work problem used
in bitcoin. Program 3 also provides a sample of a centralized
blockchain structure and shows how it prevents attacks like
double spending.
